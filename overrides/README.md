## Summary

1. Choose your setup
2. Download the required files / Run the installation scripts
3. Edit the configuration files
4. Start the services
5. Try the API
6. Customize your platform

## Setup

Pryv.io is designed to be exposed by a third party SSL termination such as NGINX.

Choose your Set-up

- Discover Open Pryv.io on your local environment, this will only allow localhost apps to connect to your platform.
  - Download docker images without SSL (quick start)
  - Download docker images with SSL
  - Native installation
- Launch Pryv.io on a server exposed to the Internet with built-in SSL, this requires to have a hostname pointing to the public IP of your server.
  - Download docker images (quick start)
  - Native installation
- Launch Pryv.io on a server with an external SSL termination. You know what you are doing.
  - Download docker images
  - Native installation

### Docker

The dockerized versions and their instructions are available at this link: [Download link](https://pryv.github.io/open-pryv.io/docker/dockerized-open-pryv-1.9.2.tgz).

If you wish to build the images yourself, refer to the following README: [docker/README-build.md](docker/README-build.md).

Once it is running, you can continue with the [tutorials](#start).

### Native

*Prerequisites*:

- Node v18.14.2 [Node.js home page](https://nodejs.org/)

The installation script has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and MacOSX.

1. `npm run setup-dev-env` to setup local file structure 
2. `npm install` to install node modules

#### Native setup with no SSL

[setup the environment](#native)

Each service independently - logs will be displayed on the console

- `npm run database` start mongodb **or** start [ferretDB](./ferretDB/README.md)
- `npm run api` start the API server on port 3000 (default)
- `npm run mail` start the mail service

#### Local native setup with backloop.dev loopback SSL

[backloop.dev](https://backloop.dev) certificates facilitate local developpment by enabling https on localhost. 

[setup the environment](#native)
- `npm run database` to start mongodb  **or** start [ferretDB](./ferretDB/README.md)
- (optional) `npm run mail` start the mail service
- `npm run apibackloop` to start api server using `configs/api-backloop.yml`

You can now access you API from you own computer with SSL on 
- `https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443`

You can check by opening [https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info](https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info)

And create new users or access token from the [Pryv Access Token Generation Page](https://pryv.github.io/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://l.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info)


#### Native setup with custom SSL

[setup the environment](#native)

1. Edit `http:ssl` part in `./configs/api.yml` file to point to your certificates an key files.
2. Update `dnsLess:publicUrl` in `./configs/api.yml` to match 
3. Run `npm run pryv` to start the API

### Config

For the native installation, edit `./configs/api.yml`

```yaml
dnsLess:
  publicUrl: http://localhost:3000
http:
  port: 3000
  ip: 127.0.0.1
auth:
  adminAccessKey: REPLACE_ME 
  trustedApps: "*@https://pryv.github.io*, *@https://*.rec.la*, *@https://*.backloop.dev*"
eventFiles:
  attachmentsDirPath: var-pryv/attachment-files
service:
  name: Open-Pryv.io
  support: https://pryv.com/open-pryv-non-configured-page/
  terms: https://pryv.com/open-pryv-non-configured-page/
  home: https://pryv.com/open-pryv-non-configured-page/
  eventTypes: https://pryv.github.io/event-types/flat.json
services:
  email:
    enabled:
      welcome: true
      resetPassword: true

```

- **publicUrl** Is the "Public" URL to reach the service, usually exposed in **https** by a third party SSL service such as NGNIX.
- **http**
  - **port** The local port to listen
  - **ip** The IP adress to use. Keep it 127.0.0.1 unless you explicitely want to expose the service in `http` to another network.
- **auth**
  - **adminAccesskey** key to use for system calls such as `/reg/admin/users`. A random key should be generated on setup.
  - **trustedApps** list of web apps that can be trusted-app functionalities
     API for trusted apps: [API reference](https://pryv.github.io/reference/)
    see: [SETUP Guide - customize authentication](https://pryv.github.io/customer-resources/pryv.io-setup/#customize-authentication-registration-and-reset-password-apps)
- **service** [API documentation on Service Information](https://pryv.github.io/reference/#service-info)
- **services:email** see [Options & Customization](#custom-email) below

## Start

At this moment you should have your application running on the public URL you defined.

- Create an account and launch the [authentication process](https://pryv.github.io/reference/#authenticate-your-app) on **App-Web-Access**: [https://pryv.github.io/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info](https://pryv.github.io/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info).
- The service info URL to your platform is: [https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info](https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443/reg/service/info)

If you are using another public URL, replace `https://my-computer.backloop.dev:4443` by it in the link above.

### Design your Data Model

Data in Pryv is stored in streams and events. We provide you with all necessary information to design your own data model in our [Data Modelling Guide](https://pryv.github.io/guides/data-modelling/) through a broad range of use cases and scenarios you might encounter.

### Try the API

After this process, you should have an account on your Open Pryv.io platform with a valid authorization token in the form of an API endpoint, you can try various **API requests** using **Postman** following this guide [https://pryv.github.io/open-api/](https://pryv.github.io/open-api/).

You can also try our [example apps with guides and tutorials](https://github.com/pryv/example-apps-web/).

## Options & Customization

### From version 1.9.2 OpenPryv.io supports Full MongoDB/FerretDB

Read [README-DBs](README-DBs.md) for more information.

### Authentication & Registration web app.

Open Pryv.io comes packaged with [app-web-auth3](https://github.com/pryv/app-web-auth3), the default web pages for app authentication, user registration and password reset.

During the set-up process it has been built and published in `public_html/access/`. To customize it, refer to its `README` in `app-web-auth3/`.

To use a new build, simply copy the contents of the generated files from `app-web-auth3/dist/` to `public_html/access/`

### Event types

Open Pryv.io comes with default **event types**.
The default ones are fetched at boot from the URL defined in service:eventTypes in the `.yml` config file, set to https://pryv.github.io/event-types/flat.json.

To customize your own, clone the [Data Types repository](https://github.com/pryv/data-types) and follow the guide there.

### MongoDB data folder

By default the MongoDB data are stored in `var-pryv/mongodb-data`. If you want to modify the folder where the MongoDB data files are stored, read [ferretDB README](./ferretDB/README.md).

### FerretDB data folder

By default the FerretDB data are stored in `var-pryv/ferretdb-data`. If you want to modify the folder where the FerretDB data files are stored, you can modify in `scripts/setup-mongodb` the variable `MONGO_DATA_FOLDER`.


### Visual assets and icons

Your platforms visuals can be customized in `public_html/assets/`, please refer to the README inside. These assets are a clone of the [assets-open-pryv.io](https://github.com/pryv/assets-open-pryv.io).
