## Local dev with SSL

1. Edit the following value in the [Config](https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io#config) file `local/dockerized-config.yml`:

```

It will run Open Pryv.io on https://my-computer.rec.la:4443, using [rec-la](https://github.com/pryv/rec-la).

If the rec-la certificates have expired, you can download valid ones at [www.rec.la](https://www.rec.la/) and place them in `rec.la-certificates/`

## Server with built-in SSL

1. Edit the following values in the [Config](https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io#config) file `production-with-ssl/dockerized-config.yml` and docker-compose file: `production-with-ssl/docker-compose.yml`:

   - ${HOSTNAME}: the hostname part of the public URL
   - auth:adminAccessKey: secret for admin functions, change it from its default value otherwise Open Pryv.io will crash on boot.

2. Run:

```bash
docker-compose -f production-with-ssl/docker-compose.yml up
```

It will run Open Pryv.io on https://${HOSTNAME}.

## Server with external SSL

1. Edit the following value in the [Config](https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io#config) file `production-no-ssl/dockerized-config.yml`:
   - ${HOSTNAME}: the hostname part of the public URL
   - auth:adminAccessKey: secret for admin functions, change it from its default value otherwise Open Pryv.io will crash on boot.
